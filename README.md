**Team Members:** 
Morgan Wessner, Maia Harmon, Veronica Bella, Samika Sanghvi

**Objective:**
 We decided to create an app that assists people who have been diagnosed with OCD in their everyday life. As OCD is commonly an overlooked issue, there arenâ€™t many services that provide 24/7 support at a low price.
